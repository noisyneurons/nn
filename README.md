# nn     - Artificial Neural Network Python library for research.

"Curriculum learning" and "learning by analogy" are the focus of this research.  The goal is to create artificial neural network algorithms that generalize well -- by using a combination of flocking (i.e., a kind of "dynamic clustering") and backpropagation of both (1) output error and (2) flocking error.

The study of processes involved in the formation of analogies is an optimistic goal of this project.  

A simple form of "flocking" is at the core of the self-organization component in these algorithms.  Initial work in this area was conducted by Matt Potter and Mark White.  More information can be obtained from [Matt Potter's MS Thesis](http://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/ir/bitstream/1840.16/148/2/etd.pdf)  The "nn" current project is a continuation of the work conducted using the Ruby "nnCore" project research code.

I am interested in discussing or collaborating with anyone interested in these aspects of neural network learning, and machine learning in general.
